Subject: Invitation for Ascend: Sovereign 2025

Dear [Sponsor’s Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Joseph Arenas, a Marketing Associate at TUP GEAR, and I’m reaching out to invite [Sponsor] to be part of our highly anticipated annual event, Ascend: Sovereign.

As one of the Philippines’ leading organization for collegiate gaming and Esports, TUP GEAR's Ascend: Sovereign aims to connect brands with a passionate audience of over 5,000 students and gaming enthusiasts through flagship tournaments (Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, Valorant, Teamfight Tactics), minor games (Honor of Kings, Tekken 😎, a cosplay showcase, and interactive on-ground booth activities.

We believe this partnership will provide mutual growth and strong brand visibility, aligning [Sponsor] with the innovation, energy, and creativity that defines our event. Attached is our organizational event primer, which detail our reach, event overview, and tiered sponsorship opportunities.

If this aligns with your brand’s goals, we’d be delighted to arrange a short meeting to discuss collaboration possibilities at your convenience.

Warm regards,
Joseph Arenas
