I. INTRODUCTION



A. DEFINITION OF TERMS

Philosophical Frameworks

* systems of moral reasoning that guide judgments about right and wrong (Chonko, n.d.).



Cultural Issues

* values, norms, and social contexts that influence how people adopt, regulate, and interact with technology (Velasco, 2021)



B. IMPORTANCE

* Help engineers interpret and apply IT laws in real contexts.
* Cross-cultural understanding helps in harmonizing ethical standards across countries.



II. PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORKS

A. Ethical Theories 

* Deontology- emphasizes duty, rules, and principles regardless of consequences (Chonko, n.d.)
* Utilitarianism- seeks the greatest good for the greatest number, weighing benefits vs harms (Chonko, n.d.)
* Virtue Ethics- focuses on the moral character and virtues of the professional (Chonko, n.d.)



B. Application of Ethical Theories to CPET and IT Laws

* RA 10175 – Cybercrime Prevention Act (2012): Engineers have a duty (deontology) to prevent illegal access, data interference, and cybercrime.
* RA 10173 – Data Privacy Act (2012): Promotes responsible and moral handling of personal data, balancing privacy and public welfare (utilitarianism).



III. CULTURAL ISSUES

A. Effect of Filipino Values to Tech Practices

* Values like pakikisama (harmony), hiya (shame), and bayanihan (community cooperation) may influence reporting or whistleblowing behavior
* Cultural preference for relational trust may affect acceptance of tech oversight or authority.



B. Digital Divide and Inclusivity Issues

* Socioeconomic disparities restrict access to hardware, internet connectivity, and digital literacy (Mangarin et al., 2024)
* Rural and underprivileged communities often have low digital competence and unequal ICT access (Esteban Jr. \& Cruz, 2021)



C. Connection of Current Filipino IT and CPET Laws to Cultural Issues

* RA 10173 – Data Privacy Act: Filipino values like pakikisama and hiya affect how people share personal data; laws emphasize consent and confidentiality.
* RA 10175 – Cybercrime Prevention Act: Addresses cultural norms on online speech and respect, aligning with societal values of responsibility and dignity.



IV. CONCLUSION

A. Importance of Culturally and Ethically Aware Computer Engineer

* Computer engineers must blend philosophical frameworks with sensitivity to local cultures to ensure responsible, lawful, and acceptable technology practice.
