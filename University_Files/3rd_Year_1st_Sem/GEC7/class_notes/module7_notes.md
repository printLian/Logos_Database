SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION

- Nicolaus Copernicus- Sparked the Scientific Revolution and proposed the Heliocentric Model. Challenging the Catholic Church's Geocentric model.
- Galileo Galilei- provided strong evidences using his telescope that the moon was not smooth.
- Johannes Kepler- Improved Copernicus' model of heliocentrism.
- Isaac Newton- Later explained planetary motion.

COPERNICAN REVOLUTION
- Changed how the people see the universe and started the scientific revolution. 
- Also helped in navigation, mapmaking and later technology such as telescopes and instruments.

CONTROVERSIES OF COPERNICAL REVOLUTION
- Science vs Religion: The Catholic church opposed heliocentrism even though according to the Bible, it is aligned with heliocentrism.
- In Job 26:7, it is said that earth suspends on nothing. Isaac Newton explained that Earth is suspendd in space through his law of motion and universal gravitation.
- Isaiah 40:22 "Earth is circle or sphere. Pythagoras declares the eart to be spheere in nature and Aristotle further supported this 


MODERN RELEVANCE OF COPERNICAN REVOLUTION
- Basis of astronomy
- Taught us to question authority and be empirical and rational

DARWINIAN REVOLUTION
- Charles Darwin
- Variation- Individuals in a species naturally differ in different physical traits such a size and weight.
- Heredity- Traits can be passed down from parents to children throughout generations.
- Natural Selection- Traits that help organisms survive and reproduce more.
- Descent with Modification- Species change over time.
- Struggle for Existence- Limited Resources causes competition.
- Adaptation- Traits developed that suit their environment better.
- Common Ancestry- All organisms trace back to a common ancestor.

HISTORICAL CONTEXT
- Pre-Darwin Science- Species never change
- Early Evolutionary Ideas- Lamarck states that traits are passed when they are used by these organisms often.
- Geology and Fossils- Proof that the Earth is old
- Malthusian Influence- Limited resources caused survival struggles
- 1859- Charles Darwin explained evolution by natural selection.

DARWIN'S CONTRIBUTION IN THE DARWINIAN CONTRIBUTION
- Explained Natural Selection
- Massive Evidence Base
- Shift in Scientific Thinking
- Impact Beyond Biology

WIDER IMPACT AND CONTROVERSIES OF THE DARWINIAN REVOLUTION
- Religious Opposition- belief that it denied human creation
- It generated scientific debate with regards to its validity.
- Utilized the theory for racism and inequality.

MODERN RELEVANCE
- Biology and Medicine- Explaines resistance, mutations and cancer.
- Environmental Science- Conservation of environment uses evolution to protect biodiversity and species nearing extinction.
- Technological Advances- The concept of evolution is utlizes for machine and deep learning. 

FREUDIAN REVOLUTION
- Sigmund Freud- founding father of psychoanalysis for treating mental illnesses and formulating lots of theories for explaining human behavior.

THEORIES AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF SIGMUND FREUD 

- Personality Structure- tripartite model of the human mind. Id= instrict and desires. Ego= mediator and your decision making self. Superego= moral principles that align with societal norms.
- Iceberg Model- explains levels of the inner mind. Tip of the iceberg would be the "conscious" which explains aware throughts and present feelings. Below the surface of the iceberg would be the "preconscious" which are memories that can be retrieved with little effort. Deep of the iceberg would be the "unconscious" which are repssed desires of the hidden mind. Traits that we want repressed and not associated to our outward persona.
- Psychosexual Development- Childhood Stages that shape personality. 
    a. Oral Stage (0-1 yo)- Infancy focus on mouth feeding and trust.
    b. Anal Stage (1-3yo)- Toilet training and todler control
    c. Phallic Stage (3-6yo)- Focus on genitals.
    d. Latency Stage (6-12yo)- Childhood calm, friendships and intellectual growth
    e. Genital Stage (12 yo to puberty)- focus on relationships and sexual + emotional balance.

- Dream Analysis- Shows that dreams show hidden desires from the unconscious.
- Psychoanalytic theory and Defense Mechanism- Explains therapy the explores the unconscious mind to treat mental disorders as well as the ego's tools to reduce conflict about the different parts of the mind. 

WIDER IMPACT
- Psychology and Psychiatry
- Philosophies and Humanities 
- Pyschotheraphy
- Neuroscience 

TURING REVOLUTION
- Alan Turing- Alan Turing encountered the Entscheidung's Problem and asked if logic to solve this problem could be automated. He then proposed and theorized a machine that could and ruled out that that machine (The Turing Machine) should be a rule-based process. Meaning that the Turing Machine can follow any clear steps. Halting Problem- some problems can't be solved by machines.
- Clutch-Turing Thesis- Anything Computable can be done by the Turing Machine.

ALAN TURING'S CONTRIBUTIONS
- 1936- Turing Machine
- 1939-1945- Codebreaking at Bletchley Park
- 1945-1946- Automatic Computing Engine (ACE)
- 1950- AI and Turing Test
- 1952- Morphogenesis (Biology + Computation)

WIDER IMPACT OF THE TURING REVOLUTION
- Foundation of Computer Science- he created the foundations of computers and defined computability.
- Artificial Intelligence- Defined what machine intelligence should look like which is mimicking human thought and behavior.
- Cybersecurity and Cryptanalysis- Turing's codebreaking during 1939-1945 proved that algortihms can be made for scripting in Cybersecurity.
- Ethical AI
- Limits of classical computation
- Quantum Computing
