INTELLECTUAL REVOLUTION
- major change in how people think, understand, and explain the world.

I. COPERNICAN REVOLUTION (HELIOCENTRIC MODEL)
- 400BCE- People thought that Earth was motionless at the center of the universe.
- 150 CE- Claudius Ptolemy, a greek astronomer, developed a geocentric (Earth Centric system) that explained the movement of planets which was called "epicycles" (circles withing circles). This became the standard for over 1400 years.
- The geocentric model was supported by the Catholic Church because it fit the belief that humans were the center of God's creation.
- 1543- Nicolaus Copernicus published the Heliocentric Model on his paper, "On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres."

JUSTIFICATION FOR HELIOCENTRIC MODEL
1. Planetary motions of epicycles were too complicated. The heliocentric model made more sense and simple.
2. Mathematical Simplicity. Paths of planets were more easier to calculate and much accurate.
3. Retrograde motion made sense.
4. Harmony. Copernicus observed that if the sun was placed in the center, different phenomena among the Earth and other planets were more systematical in behavior and ordered.
5. Ancient thinkers such as Aristarchus of Samos have already suggested a sun-centered system.  

- Copernicus died the same year he published On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres. (1543)
- His model was only accepted decades later wherein in the 1600s, works from Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler proved the heliocentric model holding true. 
- The geocentric model was believed for 2000 years in total.

II. DARWINIAN EVOLUTION (THEORY OF EVOLUTION)
- Prior to Darwin, people believed that species were created separately and never evolved. 
- 1831- Charles Darwin joined a 5-year voyage to the Galapagos Islands via the HMS Beagle. He observed different lifeforms in the island and noticed that species varied from island to island. This led Darwin to think that species changed gradually based on the environment they are in. These traits are then passed on. He called this process Natural Selection. 
- Natural Selection- Traits gained by lifeforms that are best suited to their environment which is then passed on.
- 1859- Darwin Published "On the Origin of Species" which explained how lifeforms have a common ancestor and evolve from it through natural selection leading to varied species. 

III. FREUDIAN REVOLUTION (PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY)
- Began in the 19th-20th Century when Sigmund Freud introduced a new way of understanding human psychology.
- Sigmund Freud- Neurologist from Vienna, Austria. He treated patients with illnesses that could not have been caused by physical means which led him to suspect that mental and emotional factors were behind the problem. 
- Psychoanalysis- Methodologies employed by Sigmund Freud that explored the unconscious mind, hidden memories, desires, thoughts that lead to behaviour unexpected by us. Techniues such as free association and dream analysis were under Psychoanalysis.

THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND
- Prior to Freud, people believed that humans acted upon logic and reason with full control. Sigmund Freud believed otherwise, that most of what we do are driven by unconscious desires.
- There was the conscious mind which contained the mental activities such as thoughts and perceptions. The Preconscious which contained immediate memories and stored knowledge, and lastly the unconscious, hidden desires, traits, violent motives, selfish needs and so on that we do not show in our outward persona.

FREUDS ICEBERG MODEL
1. Tip of the Iceberg; Conscious Level; Ego- The ego is the rational mind. The mediator between the impulses form id and superego.
2. Middle of the Iceberg; Preconscious Level; Super Ego- Ideals and morals derived from societal norms and other factors. The conscience of an individual.
3. Deep End of the Iceberg; Unconscious Level; Id- Basic and primal instincts and impuleses.

FREUD'S PSYCHOSEXUAL STAGES
a. Oral Stage (0-1 yo)- Infancy focus on mouth feeding and trust.
b. Anal Stage (1-3yo)- Toilet training and todler control
c. Phallic Stage (3-6yo)- Focus on genitals.
d. Latent Stage (6-12yo)- Childhood calm, friendships and intellectual growth
e. Genital Stage (12 yo to puberty)- focus on relationships and sexual + emotional balance.

COMMON DEFENSE MECHANISMS
1. Repression- Push painful memories from the conscious mind to the unconscious.
2. Denial- Refuse to accept something as true even though it is.
3. Projection- Blaming other for your own thoughts and feelings.
4. Displacement- Taking out your anger or frustration to a safer target such as loved one or family members instead of the source.
5. Regression- A return to childish behaviors when under stress. 
6. Rationalization- Make excuses to justify negative behavior. 
7. Reaction Formation- Act the opposite of how you actually feel. 
8. Sublimation- Turn unacceptable urges into acceptable actions (e.g. Working out after a breakup and stopping if you have moved on)
9. Compensation- Focus on strenghts that make up for weaknesses. 
10. Identification- Imitating someone you admire to feel positive about yourself.
11. Intellectualization- Focusing on facts and logic to avoid emotions.

IV. TURING'S REVOLUTION (THEORY OF COMPUTATION)
- During this time, mathematicians were trying to answer the Entscheidungproblem (Decision Problem)- A question that asked if there exists a method or algorithm that can assume if a mathematical statement is true or false based on pure logic alone.
 
TURING MACHINE
- simple machine that could perform any calculation given the right instructions. Simple Model made by Alan Turing in 1936 which is a theoretical concept on how the turing machine WOULD work.

Parts:
1. Tape- Infinite Strip divided into cells. Each cell holds a symbol (1, 0 or blank). This acts as the machine's memory
2. Head- Reads and writes symbols to the tape and can move either left or right one cell at a time. 
3. Control Unit- Set of rules that tells the machine what to do based on what it reads in the tape and what state it's currently in. 

Process:
1. Head reads symbol on a tape.
2. Based on the current state and the read symbol from the tape, the control unit may write a new symbol, move the head from left or right and switch to a new state.
3. Process repeats until it reaches a halt state. 

- The Turing machine laid the foundations for modern computers and algorithms
- The Turing machine was used for:
    a. Explaining Computation- The Turing machine defined what it means to computer through a machine as long as it follows a set of rules to solve any problem.
    b. Building modern computers- The Turing machine became the universal principle of what modern devices could do to solve problems.
    c. Studying algorithms
    d. Advanced Artificial Intelligence- In 1950, Turing proposed the idea that machines could think and created the Turing Test to measure AI behavior.
    e. Cryptography and Wartime Technology- The concept of the Turing machine influenced technology for helping break German Enigma Code. It also influenced the creation of the EDVAC.
    f. Shaped Computer Science- Turing proved that different fields of science could be analyzed through computation.
