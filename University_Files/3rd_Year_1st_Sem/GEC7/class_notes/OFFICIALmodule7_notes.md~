INTELLECTUAL REVOLUTION
- major change in how people think, understand, and explain the world.

COPERNICAN REVOLUTION (HELIOCENTRIC MODEL)
- 400BCE- People thought that Earth was motionless at the center of the universe.
- 150 CE- Claudius Ptolemy, a greek astronomer, developed a geocentric (Earth Centric system) that explained the movement of planets which was called "epicycles" (circles withing circles). This became the standard for over 1400 years.
- The geocentric model was supported by the Catholic Church because it fit the belief that humans were the center of God's creation.
- 1543- Nicolaus Copernicus published the Heliocentric Model on his paper, "On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres."

JUSTIFICATION FOR HELIOCENTRIC MODEL
1. Planetary motions of epicycles were too complicated. The heliocentric model made more sense and simple.
2. Mathematical Simplicity. Paths of planets were more easier to calculate and much accurate.
3. Retrograde motion made sense.
4. Harmony. Copernicus observed that if the sun was placed in the center, different phenomena among the Earth and other planets were more systematical in behavior and ordered.
5. Ancient thinkers such as Aristarchus of Samos have already suggested a sun-centered system.
