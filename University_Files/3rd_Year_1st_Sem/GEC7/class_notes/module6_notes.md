RISE OF MODERN SOCIETY AND TECHNOLOGY

19TH century influence 20th century.
- meta theoretical research (research furter).

Emergence of 20th century science.
- massive shift in science. Most of scientific breakthroughs are seen as collaborative network. 
- science was institutionalized. 
- maraming world major events na nag influence sa science. For example sa ww2 may radios and any other defence system. As for space war, maraming technologies na ginamit para ma explore ang space. Another example was cold war, in this event since russia and america were competing when it comes to which country is more advanced. Invention involves (nuclear shit).

Major Characteristics
- Big Science: Maraming big scale project ang nangyari. Dahil dito kinailangan ng advance facilities and collaboration.
- Globalization of scientific research: 
Increased colaboration. Na establish ang CERN, WHO, UNESCO
- Full integration of science and technology: science was embedding itself in societies. 

EXAMPLE SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGHS:
1. Penicillin: Alexander Fleming.
2. Atomic Bomb
3. Nuclear Energy
4. Television
5. Radio
6. Vintage Cars

TAKE NOTE: Most innovation was a collaborative effort.

POST INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY:
- Development where exonomies move from manufacturing based systems to service, knowledge, and technology driven technology.
- Focus sa pag provide ng services such as information, education professional expertise, etc..
- Daniel Bell pipularized the concept of post industrial society in his book-Coming of post industrial society book, identifying 6 key features.
1. Shoft from goods to services.
2. Rise of technical to professional workers.
3. Replacement of practical knowledge with theoretical Knowledge.
4. Ethical and theoretical implication of technology.
5. Development of new scientific disciplines.
6. Increase of universities and institutions.

CHANGES IN POST INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY:
1. Politics: less survival and focus on self expression, quality of life, and indiv well being. This shape environmental protection, women rights, and shared political participation.
2. Religion: traditional religous beliefs lose influence. There are many new beliefs like environmentalism and such.

7. Families: nabawasan ang fertility rate dahil yung mga babae ay nag tatrabaho na/nag fofocus sa carreer. 

INFORMATION AGE: 
- Focus on development. Focus on datas computers internet.
- started around mid 20th century. Continue until now. Also known as digital age. 
TECHNOLOGICAL FOUNDATION
- Microchips and personal computers
- internet and world wide web: tim berner (creator of world wide web 
).
- Mobile technology
- social media platforms
MOST FIGURES INNOVATOR
- Timber Lee: WWW.
- Bill Gates(microsoft) and Steve Jobs(apple): Leaders pf personal computer revolution.
- Mark Zuckerburg and others: Innovatprs who shaped communication through social media.
KEY EVENTS
1. Dot com Boom and Crash (1990s-2000s): rapid growth and collapse of internet based companies.
2. Rise of sillicon valley: Tech hub that symbolizes and powered digital revolution.
3. Spread of Digital Infrastructure Worldwide: Expansion of ICT globally made the information Age Universal.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL IMPACT
- Communication has been digitalized.
- Education expanded through online like e learning etc. 
- Entertainment and media moved toward streaming and interactive platforms.
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL IMPACT
