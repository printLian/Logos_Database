PROGRAMMING AND SIMULATING MCU (ARDUINO UNO)

I. ARDUINO INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (IDE)
- software designed to program arduino related projects. From Arduino.cc, it was built using Java but codes with C++. Arduino programs are called sketches and are saved throught the file extension ".ino."The IDE is usually utilized for writing, compiling and uploading codes.

II. TINKERCAD
- Web application for designing annd smimulationg electronic circuits using Computer Aided Design (CAD).

III. ARDUINO PROGRAM STRUCTURE

// Comments
#include <LibraryName.h>

const int PIN = 13;
int variable_1;
float variable_2;

void setup() {
 pinMode(PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
 digitalWrite(PIN, HIGH);
 delay(1000);
 digitalWrite(PIN, LOW);
 delay(1000);
}

3.1. Comments
3.2. Include Libraries- import external libraries that are necessary to support a program.
3.3. Constants- Values that do no change all throughtout the program. Uses the "const" syntax.
3.4. Global Variables- Variables declared outside any function and are accessbile anywhere.
    
    3.4.1. Data Types
    - Char: -128 to 127
    - Unsigned Char: 0 to 255
    - Int: −32,768 to 32,767
    - Unsigned Int: 0 to 65,535
    - Word: 0 to 65535
    - Long: −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
    - Unsigned Long: 0 to 4,294,967,295
    - Float: −3.4028235E+38 to 3.4028235E+38
    - Double: −3.4028235E+38 to 3.4028235E+38
    - String: Array of char
    - Array: Collection of Variables

3.5. Setup Function- used to initialize variables and pins (hardware on your MCU)
3.6. Loop Function- Contains the main code that works in continuous loopo.

SAMPLE PROGRAM STEPS:
Step 1: Identify the program and the components to be used.
Step 2: Compute shit needed for computation for proper current flow and para walang pumutok.
Step 3: Construct circuit in TinkerCAD
Step 4: TinkerCAD Schematic Diagram
Step 5: Apply Code and run.
