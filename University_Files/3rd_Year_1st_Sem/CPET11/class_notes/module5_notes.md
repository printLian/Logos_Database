SENSOR INTERFACE

I. SENSORS
- also known as transducers or detectors
- devices that converts physical variations into electrical signals and vice versa.

II. TYPE OF SENSORS

1. Active and Passive Sensors
	a. Active- Sensors that require external source of power (excitation voltage) to function. Transmits signals to the environment and measures the signal that comes back to these sensors. 
	b. Passive- Sensors that do not require excitation voltage. 

2. Digital and Analog Sensors
	a. Digital Sensors- Utilizes binary signals
	b. Analog Sensors- Uses raw signals.

3. Inductive Sensor- non-contact sensor that detects metallic objects. Utilizes electromagnetic induction. Basically emitting an electromagnetic field and if there are changes, then a metallic object is influencing that.

	Main Components of Inductive Sensor
	a. Field Sensor (Coil)- Coil of wire that creates the magnetic field 
	b. Oscillator- Supplies AC to the field sensor to generate the magnetic field.
	c. Demodulator- Monitors the oscillator's signal. If amplitude of oscillator fluctuates, metal is nearby.
	d. Flip-Flop- decision maker
	e. Output- self-explanatory.

4. Capacitive Sensor- detects objects of metal or non-metal material by sensing changes in capacitance of surroundings. Comparing the dielectric constant of air to another dielectric constant going inside its FOV.

5. Piezoelectric Sensor- Utilizes the piezo electric effect to measure pressure, force, acceleration and vibration. The piezoelectric effect is when a crystal generates a voltage when mechanically stressed. A piezoelectric sensor has a crystal inside it. When it is stretched or force is applied to it, the crystal would generate an electric signal.

6. Light Dependent Resistor- Known as Photoconductor, Photocell, or photoresistor. Device that controls resistance depending on intensity of light. More light means less resistance and vice versa. Indirect relationship with light.

7. Passive IR Sensor- Checks for motion by measuring infrared levels emitted by objects of living beings.

8. Moisture Sensor- Detect moist or water. Two wires are plunged into water and these will short when in contact with water, thus sending a signal.
