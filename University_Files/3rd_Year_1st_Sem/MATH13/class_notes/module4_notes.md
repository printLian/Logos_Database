Mathematical Average
1. Mean
   a. Weighted Mean
   b. Trimmed Mean
   c. Geometric/Harmonic Mean









MEAN
- average

Formula:
xbar= Summation of all elements/n

example
Response in Likert scale
Responses 1 2 3 4 5
Frequency 11 22 3 2 8

(11x1)(22x2)(3x3)(2x4)(5x8)/ 11+22+3+2+8

Mean Interpretation Scale
Step 1: Get the range
Step 2: Divide the range to n
Step 3:

Weighted Mean
Summation of w and x.

Trimmed Mean
- Trimming the highest and lowest values.
Ex.
12 12 12 34 56

Take off 56 and 12 and take the usual average.

Median
- middle value of a set of data.

Ordinal Place= (n+1)/2a

If binilang na median is between two values , apply formula if oridnal place to those two values

Mode
-Measure of greatest frequency.Measure that appears most often
