Frequency in Grouped Data without class- Ilang beses umulit ang isang element sa isang grouped data

Frequency in Grouped Data with class- Indibidual elements are grouped and the freqeuency is then presented however, hindi mo na makikita frequency ng individual elements. Class Interval yung grouped elements and class frequencies naman yung respective frequencies nila. Ung nasa left hand side ng class interval is lower class interval and nasa right is higher class interval 

Class boundary. Lower class interval -0.5, higher class interval +0.5. Then you get the class boundaries ex. 17.5-20.5 ganun. 17.5 is lower class boundary, 20.5 is higher class boundary.
